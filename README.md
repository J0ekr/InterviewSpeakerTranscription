# InterviewSpeakerTranscription
Useses Openai whsiper and pyannot.audio to transcribe audio from interviews and focus groups with speaker identification.

# Setup

- Create a `data` folder and put your audio files into that (current default is m4a but should work with any file format - have to change things in the ffmpeg code line).

- Run the notebook `00-TranscribeInterviewsSpeakerdetection.ipynb` - pip install missing packages

## TODO

- [ ] Add pip installs for all packages to the notebook
- [ ] Improve README
